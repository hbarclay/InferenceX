# A stale hugepage reservation is carved out of normal RAM and can make
# HiCache host-pool sizing fail at startup; this reclaims it, or grows the
# pool when a caller (the UMBP DRAM tier) needs hugepages.
#
# Safety: a shrink only releases idle pages. Pages in use or reserved (Rsvd)
# are kept: the kernel never shrinks the pool below in-use + reserved, and
# turns held pages above the target into surplus pages that are freed once
# their owner releases them.

# Exit code: 0 = OK or skipped; 1 = a needed change could not be made (large
# leftover reservation, or a grow short by more than the tolerance).
