# srt-slurm patches

`setup_srt_slurm()` in [`runners/slurm_utils.sh`](../../slurm_utils.sh) applies every `*.patch` here to the job's srt-slurm clone after checking out the pinned submodule. TileRT jobs use the fork checkout and skip these patches.

Each patch is a temporary fix for an open upstream PR. When the PR merges and the submodule pin includes it, delete the patch and its row.
